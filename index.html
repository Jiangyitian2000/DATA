        <h1>Food deserts in Singapore</h1>

        <p><i>Food deserts in Singapore</i> is a data visualziation project that shows neighborhoods in Singapore that might suffer from access to fresh food options. 
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> utilizes government open data that displays the location of supermarkets and hawker centers as a source of fresh food and calculates the walkshed of access to fresh food locations as 500 meters of network distance from all HDB flats in Sinagpore.
            <br><br>
            Through the <i>crowdsourced map</i>, users can report alternative sources of fresh food through the ushahidi platform.
